        <h1>COME FILL A BUMPER</h1> 
        <br>
        <p>On or about nineteen hundred and two, Mr. Rohrbeck was given a job to do.<br>
            With brushes in hand and gnomes in his head, he created the masterpiece on the wall above.<br>
            First home for the paintings was the old Giltedge Bar, east of here, but not too far.<br>
            Streets were of dirt, sidewalks of wood, hitching posts for horses, business was good.<br>
            Beer for a nickel, whiskey for a dime, sandwiches a quarter any old time.<br>
            Prohibition was next, and became the law, the Ambassador, a speakeasy, called “Hole in the Wall”<br>
            Paintings were rolled and stored away, for twelve long years in the dust they lay.<br>
            At last came nineteen thirty-three, the law was repealed and Bacchus was free.<br>
            Saloons and taverns opened their doors, folks danced, sang, and drank spirits once more.<br>
            The old bar was hauled out of its storage place, and the paintings were hung on the walls they now grace.<br>
            The artist, long gone, would be proud if he knew, that folks still enjoy them as much as they do.</p>
